# Advanced Programming
This repository contains the codes for the course Advanced Programming in 2017. In the first part of the course, I focused on learning advanced topics such as exceptions, filing, and object-oriented programming in Java. In the second part, I started learning Python and getting to know some preliminary libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pygame.\
The final project in this course was to develop a modified version of the snake game.
